title: Skepticism of Forced AI Cooperation
---

**Skepticism of Forced AI Cooperation** is a viewpoint articulated by analyst Rui Ma which expresses significant doubt towards the prevalent narrative that the perceived [[AI existential risk|existential risk]] posed by advanced artificial intelligence will inevitably compel geopolitical rivals, specifically the United States and China, into collaborative governance. This skepticism is grounded in a historical and pragmatic analysis of how other global crises have failed to surmount entrenched [[geopolitical divides]].

### Analogy to Other Existential Risks
Central to Rui Ma's argument is the direct analogy drawn between the hypothetical existential risk from AI and the ongoing, demonstrably real existential threats of global pandemics and climate change. She observes that these tangible, present-day crises, which threaten humanity on a global scale, have not succeeded in forging sustained, unconditional cooperation between nations with competing interests. The persistence of national self-interest, strategic competition, and mistrust in these domains serves as a powerful historical precedent. This comparison underpins her core doubt: if these proven, active catastrophes cannot force a unified response, it is questionable that a future, debated AI risk would succeed where others have persistently failed.

### Rejection of AI as a "Magic Bullet"
From this analogy, Rui Ma explicitly rejects the notion that AI risk possesses a unique, overriding power to dissolve geopolitical tensions. She challenges the assumption that the scale of the AI threat would act as a singular, compelling force, or a "magic bullet," that finally aligns adversarial powers. Her critique suggests that proponents of forced cooperation may be overestimating the persuasive power of a speculative future risk while underestimating the durability of current competitive dynamics. As she states:

> "I don't know. That's... that's kind of a weird headline to me because we have some other really real existential risks like global pandemics [and] climate change and that hasn't made anyone who does not want to work together work together. So I'm not really convinced that AI will be that magic bullet."

This quote encapsulates the pragmatic heart of her skepticism: historical evidence from parallel crises suggests that the willingness to cooperate is a pre-existing political condition, not one manufactured by the severity of a threat alone.

### Implications for AI Governance Discourse
Rui Ma's perspective introduces a crucial note of political realism into discussions about global [[AI governance]]. It implies that strategies for managing AI risks may need to account for a future where comprehensive US-China collaboration is not a given, regardless of the stakes invoked by experts. This viewpoint encourages a more nuanced analysis that factors in persistent competition, potentially advocating for parallel governance frameworks, resilient systems, and strategies that can manage risk within a context of continued rivalry, rather than relying on the expectation that risk itself will eliminate that rivalry.
