title: Practical Functional Robots
---

**Practical Functional Robots** is a concept and design philosophy in robotics, articulated by entrepreneur and investor Gabriele Tinelli, that prioritizes the development of robots capable of performing tangible, useful work in the physical world. It advocates for a shift in focus from theoretical research or social robots toward creating machines that solve concrete problems through physical action, with the explicit goal of building sustainable commercial enterprises around them. The philosophy is inherently applied and commercial, contrasting with purely academic or exploratory robotics.

### Philosophical Foundations
At its core, the concept argues that the primary value of robotics lies in its capacity to execute tasks that require interaction with and manipulation of the physical environment. Tinelli emphasizes moving beyond demonstration models or robots limited to digital or social interaction, championing instead systems designed for reliability and utility in real-world settings. This approach is summarized in the central tenet:

> "Robots That Work"

This phrase underscores the necessity for robustness, practical functionality, and economic viability as non-negotiable attributes for next-generation robotic systems.

### Commercial Imperative
A defining aspect of Practical Functional Robots is its direct link to commercial strategy. Tinelli posits that for the robotics industry to mature and scale significantly, it must be driven by companies whose products deliver clear economic value. This involves identifying specific, high-value tasks where robotic automation is superior to human labor, whether due to precision, endurance, cost, or operating in dangerous environments. The concept is explicitly framed as a blueprint for entrepreneurship:

> "How to build companies around robots that exert physical actions."

This perspective guides not only technical design but also business model development, market selection, and investment priorities, advocating for startups that address well-defined industrial, logistics, agricultural, or infrastructure challenges.

### Technological Focus
While not prescribing specific technologies, the philosophy implies a focus on integrated systems engineering. Key areas of development include advanced actuation, robust sensing for unstructured environments, reliability engineering to minimize downtime, and software for task planning and execution that requires minimal customization. The end goal is a robot that can be deployed, operated, and maintained with a clear return on investment, moving from laboratory prototypes to essential tools in industry and commerce.

The concept of Practical Functional Robots has been influential in discussions about the [[Future of Robotics]] investment and entrepreneurship, serving as a call to align technological innovation with market needs and practical utility.
