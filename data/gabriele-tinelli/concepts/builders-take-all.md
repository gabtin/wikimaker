title: Builders Take All
---

**"Builders Take All"** is a concept in venture capital and technology investment, particularly within the robotics industry, popularized by investor and writer Gabriele Tinelli. It posits that long-term dominance and value capture in robotics will not be determined solely by theoretical research, platform strategies, or financial engineering, but by the teams that successfully build and deploy tangible, integrated robotic solutions to solve specific, real-world industrial problems. The phrase is a deliberate echo of the "winner-takes-all" dynamic observed in software, adapted to emphasize the unique physical and integrative challenges of robotics.

## Concept and Background
The concept emerged as a counterpoint to investment theses that prioritized pure artificial intelligence research or "robotics-as-a-service" platform models without deep domain integration. Tinelli argues that robotics is fundamentally different from pure software due to its interaction with the unpredictable physical world. Success requires a multidisciplinary approach combining mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, software, and, critically, deep operational knowledge of the target industry, such as manufacturing, logistics, or agriculture. The "Builder" in this context is therefore a team or company that masters this full-stack integration to create a working product that delivers measurable return on investment in a traditional industrial setting.

## Core Argument
Tinelli's argument centers on the complexity of deploying robotics in established industries with entrenched processes. He contends that simply having advanced algorithms is insufficient; the winning entities will be those that navigate the challenges of hardware reliability, safety, user training, and maintenance. This hands-on, solution-oriented approach de-risks adoption for customers and creates significant competitive moats, as these solutions are difficult to replicate without similar depth of experience and integration capability.

In his writings, he frames this as a primary lens for investment:
> "Builders Take All"
>
> "Theses, takes and musings on [[Investing in Robotics]] for traditional industries"

This suggests that investors should back teams capable of executing on this full-stack builder philosophy, as they are best positioned to capture the value their creations generate.

## Implications and Reception
The "Builders Take All" concept has influenced discussion around robotics venture capital, shifting focus toward companies that demonstrate not just technological innovation but also proven deployment and domain expertise. It underscores a broader trend in "hard tech" or "physical tech" investing, where success is seen as dependent on bridging the gap between innovation and industrial practicality. Critics of a strict interpretation might argue it underemphasizes the role of foundational AI breakthroughs or scalable platform software. Nevertheless, the phrase has become a shorthand for advocating a hands-on, integrated, and industry-specific approach to [[Building Robotics Companies]].
