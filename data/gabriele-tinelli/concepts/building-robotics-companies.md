title: Building Robotics Companies
---

Building robotics companies, as discussed by entrepreneur and investor Gabriele Tinelli, refers to the strategic process of founding and scaling ventures centered on the creation of robots that perform tasks in the physical world. This concept moves beyond robotics as a purely technological discipline to focus on the unique business, operational, and market challenges inherent in commercializing systems that interact with and manipulate their environment. Tinelli's perspective is particularly focused on the transition from traditional industrial tools to intelligent, automated robotic systems.

## Core Thesis
Tinelli's central thesis emphasizes a shift in industrial and service automation, advocating for the creation of companies built specifically around the capabilities of advanced robotics. He frames this as a fundamental evolution in how physical work is accomplished, moving from passive tools to active, programmable agents. A guiding principle of this approach is the focus on actionable outcomes:
> "How to build companies around robots that exert physical actions."

## Conceptual Framework: From Tooling to Robots
A key element of Tinelli's analysis is the conceptual progression from conventional tooling to fully-fledged robotic systems. This is not merely a replacement but a paradigm shift in functionality and intelligence.
*   **Tooling:** Refers to specialized, often static equipment designed for a specific, repetitive task. It requires significant human operation and control.
*   **Robots:** Represent flexible, sensor-driven, and software-defined machines capable of adaptive physical action. They are characterized by a degree of autonomy, programmability, and the ability to perceive and respond to their environment.

The transition "from tooling to robots" involves embedding sensing, intelligence, and adaptability into physical hardware, thereby creating more versatile and valuable solutions. This framework helps entrepreneurs identify opportunities where robotic automation offers a clear advantage over existing manual or mechanized processes.

## Strategic Implications
Building companies within this domain presents distinct strategic considerations, as outlined in Tinelli's discussions:
*   **Problem-First Approach:** Successful robotics companies often begin by identifying a high-value, repetitive, or dangerous physical task in industries like logistics, agriculture, construction, or manufacturing. The technology is then developed as a solution to this clearly defined problem.
*   **Integration of Disciplines:** It requires a deep integration of traditionally separate fields: mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, software development (particularly AI and machine vision), and systems integration. Company building must foster tight collaboration between these disciplines.
*   **Business Model Challenges:** Entrepreneurs must navigate complex business models involving high initial hardware costs, deployment and maintenance logistics, and sometimes robotics-as-a-service (RaaS) offerings to lower adoption barriers.
*   **Iterative Development and Deployment:** Unlike pure software, physical robots require extensive testing in real-world conditions. A strategy of iterative prototyping and pilot deployments is crucial for refining both the technology and its market fit.

## Influence and Context
While not a formal academic theory, Tinelli's articulated views synthesize practical experience from the field. His insights are frequently cited in discussions on robotics entrepreneurship, offering a pragmatic framework for investors and founders evaluating opportunities in the physically-embodied AI and automation sectors. The concept underscores the growing recognition of robotics as a distinct and challenging category of venture creation.
