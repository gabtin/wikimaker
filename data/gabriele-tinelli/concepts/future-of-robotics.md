title: Future of Robotics
---

**Future of Robotics (Gabriele Tinelli)** refers to the set of principles, design philosophies, and anticipated technological directions for advancing robotic systems as articulated by engineer and entrepreneur Gabriele Tinelli. His perspective emphasizes pragmatic, incremental innovation focused on utility and real-world application over speculative or purely humanoid forms. Tinelli's outlook is significantly influenced by pioneering roboticists like Rodney Brooks and is exemplified in advocacy for unconventional designs such as wheeled humanoids.

## Core Principles
Tinelli's approach to building for the future of robotics is grounded in practicality and iterative development. He argues for a focus on creating robots that solve immediate, tangible problems rather than pursuing distant visions of general human-like androids. This involves prioritizing robustness, cost-effectiveness, and specific functionality in unstructured environments. A central tenet is that the future of the field will be built through continuous, measurable improvements to existing platforms and software stacks.

> His writing frames the challenge as "how to build for the future of robotics," suggesting a hands-on, engineering-focused pathway.

## Influences and Design Philosophy
Tinelli frequently cites the work of Rodney Brooks, particularly the concepts of behavior-based robotics and embodied intelligence. Brooks's influence is seen in the preference for decentralized control systems and robots that interact directly with their environment through sensing and action, rather than relying solely on complex internal world models. This philosophy champions simplicity and emergent intelligence from simpler components.

This influence materializes in Tinelli's interest in non-traditional morphologies. He has pointed to designs like **wheeled humanoids** as indicative of a pragmatic direction. Such hybrids prioritize mobility efficiency (wheels) in controlled settings while retaining manipulative capabilities (upper humanoid torso) for tasks designed for human spaces, representing a break from the dogma of bipedal locomotion as a necessary goal.

## Specific Technical Directions
The discussed future involves several key technical avenues:
*   **Wheeled Locomotion and Hybrid Systems:** Advocating for wheels or tracked systems where practical, viewing legged locomotion as a solution only for specific, uneven terrain requirements rather than a universal ideal.
*   **Incremental Autonomy:** Developing robots that operate with scalable autonomy, often in collaboration with humans, rather than pursuing full, unsupervised intelligence from the outset.
*   **Software and AI Integration:** Emphasizing the role of advances in machine learning and computer vision to improve robot perception and task planning, but always integrated with reliable mechanical and control systems.
*   **Commercial Viability:** Stressing the importance of economic factors, including manufacturability, safety, and total cost of ownership, as critical drivers for widespread adoption.

## Reception and Context
While not representing a singular school of thought, Tinelli's views align with a growing segment of the robotics industry focused on commercial deployment in fields like logistics, inspection, and assisted living. His perspective serves as a counterpoint to more futurist narratives, anchoring the "future of robotics" in present-day engineering constraints and market needs. The discussion around wheeled humanoids, in particular, sparks debate about the optimal form factors for robots intended to operate in human-centric environments.
