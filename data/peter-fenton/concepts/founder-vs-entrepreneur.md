title: Founder vs Entrepreneur
---

In venture capital discourse, Peter Fenton, a general partner at Benchmark, draws a critical distinction between the commonly conflated terms **Founder** and **Entrepreneur**. For Fenton, a **founder** is someone who starts a company, an act that becomes more frequent in attractive or "hot" markets. An **entrepreneur**, however, represents a rarer, more constant **phenotype** driven by innate qualities like substance, leverage, and a fundamental independence from external validation systems. This framework suggests that while the number of founders fluctuates with market trends, the population of true entrepreneurs remains stable.

## The Founder: A Function of Market Conditions
Fenton posits that the act of founding a company is heavily influenced by the surrounding market environment. In periods of high capital availability, technological excitement, or "hype," the number of people who become founders increases dramatically. These individuals are often responding to the perceived opportunity and incentives of the moment. They may be adept at recognizing and riding a market wave, securing funding, and launching a venture. However, Fenton implies that this identity can be situational—a role adopted when conditions are favorable. As he observes,
> "When you find in a in a market like we're in the number of founders increases geometrically... I think the number of entrepreneurs stays as a fixed constant."

This geometric increase in founders is contrasted with the static nature of the entrepreneurial core.

## The Entrepreneur: A Constant Phenotype of Substance and Leverage
For Fenton, an entrepreneur is defined not by a single act but by a persistent set of intrinsic characteristics. This **phenotype** exists independent of market cycles. The first key trait is **substance**—a deep, authentic insight or expertise that forms the bedrock of the venture, rather than a trend-chasing idea. The second is a unique approach to **leverage**. As Fenton notes,
> "entrepreneurs have this guile there there's a sense of of leverage."

This leverage is the creative and strategic skill to achieve disproportionate outcomes, whether through technology, business model innovation, or network effects, using minimal initial resources.

Crucially, the entrepreneur operates from an internal compass, fundamentally rejecting conventional **external validation systems**. This means they are not primarily motivated by accolades, press coverage, or the approval of specific investor circles. Their drive comes from a vision they are uniquely equipped to execute. While they may use market dynamics to their advantage, they are not defined or created by them. Their constancy is what makes them both rare and valuable; they are the builders who persist and innovate across different market climates, not just during boom times.

In essence, Fenton's framework suggests all entrepreneurs can be founders, but not all founders embody the deeper, constant traits of an entrepreneur. The distinction is vital for identifying the individuals capable of building substantive, enduring companies versus those launching ventures that are more reflective of transient market conditions.
