title: First Call Partner
---

The "First Call Partner" is a concept articulated by venture capitalist Peter Fenton of Benchmark, describing the firm's foundational aspiration in its relationships with entrepreneurs. It signifies a commitment to being the primary and most trusted confidant for founders, extending far beyond the provision of capital. This model prioritizes building deep, authentic trust so that Benchmark becomes the instinctive contact during pivotal moments, especially crises. As Fenton frames it, the goal is to transform the venture capital relationship from a transactional financial agreement into a foundational partnership built on availability and genuine support.

## The Aspiration of Primary Partnership
At its core, the "First Call Partner" ideal is about achieving a position of paramount trust and influence. Fenton explicitly states Benchmark's objective:
> "We want to be the first call for an entrepreneur and we want to be their most important and most impactful partner."
This means that when an entrepreneur faces a major decision, challenge, or opportunity, their initial instinct is to contact their partner at Benchmark. The concept rejects the notion of a passive or distant investor, aiming instead for a role embedded in the strategic and emotional fabric of the company's journey. Being the first call is a testament to the partner's perceived value, judgment, and the safety of the relationship, making it a central tenet of [[Authentic Partnership]].

## Building Trust Through Crisis and Availability
Fenton emphasizes that the true test of a "First Call Partner" occurs during difficult times. Trust is not built solely on successes but on unwavering support when problems arise. He pinpointed this with a direct question:
> "Who do you call first when you hit a patch of bad news? Like who do you share that with? We want to be that person."
Becoming that person requires deliberate effort in cultivating [[Radical Candor]] and confidentiality. It demands that investors be consistently available and approachable, creating an environment where entrepreneurs feel secure sharing vulnerabilities without fear of judgment or punitive reactions. This availability during setbacks demonstrates that the partnership is resilient and not merely fair-weather, solidifying a bond that enhances collaboration during all phases of growth.

## The Role Beyond Capital
The "First Call" model fundamentally redefines the venture capitalist's contribution. While funding is a necessary entry point, Fenton argues that the highest value lies in being a strategic and emotional co-pilot. This approach aligns with principles of [[Value-Added Investing]], where the investor's deep involvement and network accelerate problem-solving and growth. By focusing on the human element of the relationship—offering insight, experience, and moral support—Benchmark seeks to ensure its partnership is indispensable. The capital becomes almost secondary to the counsel and reliability provided, making the firm a true architect of success rather than just a financier.
