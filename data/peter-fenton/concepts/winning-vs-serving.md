title: Winning vs. Serving
---

**Winning vs. Serving** is a venture capital philosophy articulated by investor Peter Fenton, which contrasts two opposing mindsets in VC-founder relationships. "Winning" refers to the transactional act of securing an investment in a company, while "Serving" describes a long-term, partnership-oriented commitment to the company's journey over many years and through inevitable challenges. Fenton argues that a true venture partnership is defined by the latter.

## The Transactional Nature of "Winning"
In this framework, "winning" is the act of a venture capitalist successfully getting their capital into a sought-after deal. It is a short-term, competitive event focused on a single point in time—the closing of the investment round. This mindset is often characterized by a focus on metrics, market hype, and outmaneuvering other investors to "win" the allocation. As Fenton notes, this creates a pattern where the investor must quickly move on:
> "Winning was a is a transaction of like take my capital and I got to get on to the next one because if you win you got to win the next one."
The risk of a pure "winning" orientation is that the investor's involvement may be superficial, prioritizing the deal itself over the subsequent, difficult work of company-building.

## The Long-Term Commitment of "Serving"
In contrast, "serving" is defined by a deep, enduring commitment that begins after the investment is made. Fenton emphasizes that his firm's involvement is measured in decades, not moments. This involves active partnership through multiple phases of growth, executive transitions, market pivots, and periods of crisis. The investor's role evolves into one of service to the company and its founder, providing support, counsel, and stability.
> "Winning is is a moment in time. We average in our boards 10 plus years."
This decade-long horizon reframes the entire relationship. Success is not measured by securing the deal, but by contributing to the company's long-term health and maturity. It requires a foundation of [[Founder-VC Alignment]] and a shared vision for a lengthy journey.

## Contrast and Practical Implications
The distinction has significant practical implications. A "serving" model demands that a VC firm say "yes" to very few companies each year, as each commitment consumes a substantial portion of a partner's time and focus for many years. Fenton summarizes this selective, deep engagement:
> "we we say yes once or twice a year serve for a decade long."
This approach prioritizes [[Long-term Partnership]] over portfolio quantity. It shifts the investor's identity from a financier who "wins" deals to a steadfast partner who "serves" the company's mission, aligning the investor's success entirely with the company's long-term success rather than the short-term act of investment.
