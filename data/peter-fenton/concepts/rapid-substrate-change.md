title: Rapid Substrate Change
---

**Rapid Substrate Change** is a concept articulated by venture capitalist Peter Fenton to describe the unprecedented pace at which the foundational technology layers, or "substrate," of artificial intelligence are evolving. He argues this pace far exceeds that of previous technological eras, such as cloud computing, creating a uniquely dynamic and demanding environment for startups. In this context, a founder's most critical skill is not just building a static product but continuously navigating this shifting ground, identifying where new competitive advantages—or "edges"—can be built as old ones erode.

### The Accelerated Pace of Technological Change
Fenton contrasts the current AI revolution with earlier platform shifts. Historically, major shifts in foundational technology occurred over years or even decades, allowing businesses time to establish and solidify their positions. The cloud computing era, for instance, saw a relatively steady evolution. In stark contrast, the AI substrate—encompassing core model architectures, training methodologies, hardware optimizations, and toolchains—is now undergoing fundamental changes at a quarterly cadence. As Fenton observes:

> "you're getting more change like every quarter than you know we did in a decade in terms of the substrate."

This hyper-acceleration means that the technical assumptions underlying a product can become obsolete in mere months. A moat built on a specific model's capability or a unique technical implementation can deteriorate rapidly as the open-source community and large labs release new breakthroughs. This turns strategic planning into a continuous process of reassessment.

### Implications for Founders and Startup Strategy
The primary implication of Rapid Substrate Change is that a founder's adaptability and foresight become their most valuable assets. Success is less about defending a fixed position and more about running a continuous cycle of learning, adaptation, and re-positioning. Founders must be deeply attuned to shifts in the underlying [[technological substrate]] to anticipate where their current edge might fade and where a new one could be seized.

> "so a founders's ability to navigate that and actually like understand where their edge is and where their edge is going to come from and how quickly the moats are deteriorating ... it's critical."

This environment elevates the importance of [[Founder-Market Fit]] to an extreme degree; the "market" in this case includes the fast-moving substrate itself. A founder must excel not only in understanding customer pain points but also in interpreting how each substrate shift opens new avenues to solve those problems or creates entirely new categories. Strategy becomes fluid, requiring teams to build with modularity and to maintain the agility to pivot their technical approach without losing sight of their core mission. The ability to learn and integrate new paradigms quickly is, therefore, a more sustainable advantage than any single technical implementation.
