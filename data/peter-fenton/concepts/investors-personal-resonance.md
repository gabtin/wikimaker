title: Investor's Personal Resonance
---

**Investor's Personal Resonance** is a concept in venture capital, articulated by investor Peter Fenton, which advises entrepreneurs to select their investors based on a deep, personal alignment and explicit commitment, rather than on competitive terms or prestige alone. It shifts the decision criterion from which investor wants to "win" the deal to which investor demonstrates the most profound belief in and connection to the entrepreneur's journey. This philosophy emphasizes that the highest-value capital is "smart capital" paired with genuine partnership, which must be actively defined and secured by the founder.

## The Primacy of Personal Resonance

Fenton argues that during a fundraising process, entrepreneurs should look beyond surface-level enthusiasm or favorable term sheets. The critical question to ask is not who offers the best valuation, but who demonstrates the most authentic and personal investment in the founder's vision and success. This resonance is a felt sense of alignment in values, communication style, and strategic mindset. It is the foundation for a trusting, long-term partnership that will endure the inevitable challenges of building a company.

> "the question I would be asking if I was an entrepreneur is which of these esteemed venture capitalists is most personally resonant with you and committed to you."

This focus on resonance is closely related to the idea of [[The Founder-VC Fit]], which examines the mutual alignment beyond financial transaction. An investor who is personally resonant acts as a true believer and advocate, providing not just capital but also moral support, strategic clarity, and a deep understanding of the founder's context.

## Codifying Commitment into Concrete Actions

A central and actionable tenet of this concept is that feelings of resonance and verbal assurances are insufficient. Fenton insists that entrepreneurs must demand tangible, operational proof of an investor's promised commitment. This process transforms abstract support into a defined, accountable framework for engagement.

> "Codify it. Like make them be explicit about the kind of commitment they're going to make and make it uncomfortably concrete."

"Uncomfortably concrete" actions are specific, recurring, and meaningful obligations that require the investor's direct time and attention. Examples include a standing weekly or bi-weekly call, a commitment to regular strategic reviews, or clear protocols for escalation during crises. This codification serves two purposes: it verifies the investor's seriousness (separating true partners from those merely making promises), and it establishes a concrete [[Governance Model]] for the relationship from the outset. It ensures the investor’s support is tactical and accessible, moving beyond vague promises of being "available as needed" or providing only high-level [[Strategic vs. Tactical Support]].

In essence, the concept of Investor's Personal Resonance provides a framework for entrepreneurs to seek and secure a capital partner whose commitment is both deeply felt and formally embedded into the operating rhythm of the company.
