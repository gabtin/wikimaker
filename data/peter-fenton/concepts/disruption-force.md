title: Disruption Force
---

**Disruption Force** is a concept articulated by venture capitalist Peter Fenton to describe a powerful, specific technological or market shift that acts as a catalyst, suddenly enabling a new cohort of entrepreneurs to envision and pursue transformative companies. This is not a gradual evolution but a sharp, discrete event that creates a distinct "before" and "after." The force of the disruption unlocks a previously latent entrepreneurial vision, awakening founders who, just months prior, could not see the new landscape of opportunity it creates.

## The Catalyst Event
A Disruption Force is not a broad trend or a slow-moving wave of innovation. It is a concrete, often publicly identifiable event that dramatically changes the foundational capabilities or economics of a sector. Fenton points to events like the release of a groundbreaking new AI model as a prime example. Such an event suddenly provides a new tool, platform, or capability that was previously inaccessible or unimaginably expensive. This event serves as the catalyst that resets the playing field, rendering old assumptions obsolete and creating a blank canvas for new applications and business models. It is the shock to the system that makes the next wave of startups possible.

## Awakening Latent Entrepreneurial Vision
The core of Fenton’s idea is the impact of the disruption on the perception of potential founders. Before the catalyst event, a group of talented individuals may have been technically skilled and interested in a domain but were "dormant" because they could not see a clear, compelling path to building a defining company. The Disruption Force changes their vision literally overnight. As Fenton states:
> "the force of that disruption has awakened a whole group of entrepreneurs that were otherwise not seeing things they were seeing that now they weren't seeing them 3 months ago."

This paradoxical statement captures the sudden shift: founders are now seeing a world of specific opportunities ("things they were seeing") that was completely invisible to them just a quarter earlier. The disruption provides a new lens, suddenly making a previously complex or intractable problem seem solvable and ripe for innovation. It aligns their capabilities with a newly possible future.

## Emergence of a New Founder Wave
The ultimate outcome of a Disruption Force is the rapid formation of a new generation of startups. The awakened entrepreneurs, sharing a common revelation prompted by the catalyst event, begin to build the foundational companies of the new paradigm. This creates a concentrated wave of founding activity, often within a 12-18 month window following the disruption. These founders are uniquely positioned because their vision is freshly unlocked and unburdened by the legacy thinking that may constrain established players. They are able to build with [[First-Principles Thinking]], leveraging the new force from the ground up rather than adapting old systems to it. This wave is what turns a technological disruption into a broad-based economic and market transformation.
