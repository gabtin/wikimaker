title: Misunderstanding of Board Seats
---

The **Misunderstanding of Board Seats**, as articulated by venture capitalist Peter Fenton, refers to a common but flawed perception in the startup ecosystem. This perception frames a board seat primarily as a mechanism for investor governance and control over a company. Fenton argues against this view, contending that a board seat should instead be understood as a commitment to actively work on the company's growth and challenges. He criticizes the trend of selling "no board seat" arrangements to founders as a benefit, viewing it as a disingenuous practice that ultimately deprives entrepreneurs of a valuable partnership.

## The Governance and Control Misconception
In traditional corporate settings and often in early-stage investing, board seats are frequently associated with oversight, accountability, and formal authority. This leads to the misconception that an investor taking a board seat is primarily about exercising control or monitoring management. Fenton observes that this view is prevalent and damaging, as it creates an adversarial dynamic between founders and investors. It fosters a mindset where the board is seen as a regulatory body rather than a collaborative resource. This misunderstanding can make founders wary of ceding board representation, fearing loss of autonomy.

## Boards as Signing Up to Work
Contrasting the conventional view, Fenton proposes a more constructive paradigm. He emphasizes that accepting a board seat should be seen as a pledge to roll up one's sleeves and contribute directly to the company's success. This is not about passive governance but about active partnership and problem-solving.

> "there's like a misunderstanding of boards as governance and control rather than boards as like signing up to work on the company which I think is like how it should be understood,"

In this model, a board member's role is akin to a committed [[Operational Partner]] who leverages experience, networks, and insight to assist the founding team. The focus shifts from monitoring to mentoring, from control to collaboration. This approach aligns the board's incentives with the company's long-term health, transforming the boardroom into a strategic asset rather than a bureaucratic checkpoint.

## The Disingenuous Sale and Founder Deprivation
Fenton extends his critique to the practice of investors marketing "no board seat" terms as a superior deal for founders. He argues that this sales pitch exploits the common misunderstanding to attract entrepreneurs who prize control, but it ultimately does them a disservice.

> "it has been very effectively and somewhat what disingenuously sold the founders because it like sounds good and you just keep control of your company and there's no risk and that means that we don't have to help them"

By avoiding board seats, investors may sidestep the deep commitment and responsibility that comes with formal involvement. This leaves founders without the structured, obligated partnership that a dedicated board member provides. Instead of gaining a true [[Board Partner]] engaged in the company's fortunes, founders are left with a more passive investor relationship. This deprivation can hinder access to critical guidance during pivotal moments, such as scaling challenges or strategic pivots, where experienced board involvement is most valuable. Fenton's perspective urges founders to seek investors willing to embody the work ethic of a true board partner, rather than those offering hollow promises of undisturbed control.
