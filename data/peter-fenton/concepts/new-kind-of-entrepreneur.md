title: New Kind of Entrepreneur
---

**New Kind of Entrepreneur** is a concept articulated by venture capitalist Peter Fenton to describe a unique archetype of founder that emerges during periods of foundational technological or social change. This entrepreneur arises not merely to iterate on existing ideas, but to build what was previously unimaginable because the underlying [[Disruptive Cycle]] is so profound that it is fundamentally misunderstood by the prevailing business and investment establishment. The "new kind" is defined by their unique capacity to see and act upon possibilities invisible to insiders.

## The Primacy of Extreme Disruption
The genesis of this new archetype is not incremental change, but a rupture in the technological or market landscape so deep that it creates a conceptual vacuum. The existing ecosystem—comprised of successful companies, investors, and experts—lacks the mental models to comprehend the new paradigm. Fenton's core observation is that the disruption and the entrepreneur are intrinsically linked: the very incomprehensibility of the moment creates the space for a different kind of builder to emerge. As he states:
> "there's something so disruptive that no one can fully understand it and then there's a completely new kind of entrepreneur that emerges."

This suggests that the entrepreneur is not just a beneficiary of the change, but a necessary byproduct of it. The new rules are so different that they can only be written by those unburdened by the old ones.

## Characteristics of the New Archetype
This entrepreneur typically operates from a perspective of deep, often intuitive, conviction that runs counter to conventional wisdom. Because the opportunity is opaque to the mainstream, they are frequently outsiders relative to the industry they aim to transform. They may lack traditional credentials or a conventional pedigree that would signal credibility to existing power centers. Their strength lies in a novel vision and the tenacity to pursue it despite widespread skepticism, effectively becoming the first experts in a domain that does not yet formally exist. They are defined more by their unique insight into the emerging [[Disruptive Cycle]] than by their resume.

## Ecosystem Blindspot and Emergence
A critical component of Fenton's concept is the reactive posture of the established ecosystem. Incumbent players and many traditional investors suffer from an [[Ecosystem Blindspot]], unable to accurately value the new venture or its founder because their judgment is clouded by success in the previous cycle. This initial lack of understanding and funding often serves as a crucible, forcing the new kind of entrepreneur to bootstrap, seek unconventional allies, and validate their vision through early user adoption rather than expert approval. Their eventual success serves to redefine the ecosystem's understanding of the disruption itself, often catalyzing a wave of followers and imitators who then operate with the benefit of the new map this entrepreneur has drawn.
