title: Residual Economics & Legacy
---

**Residual Economics & Legacy** refers to a foundational principle at the venture capital firm Benchmark, as articulated by partner Peter Fenton. It describes the firm's radical policy that a partner who retires or leaves the partnership receives no ongoing, residual financial stake in the firm's future profits. This policy is consciously designed to elevate the long-term health of the firm's culture and collective mission over individual financial entitlement, framing a partner's true reward as the enduring legacy they help build.

## The Radical Norm of No Residual Economics
At most professional firms, senior partners who have contributed to the firm's success typically retain some form of "carried interest" or profit-sharing in future funds after they depart. Benchmark explicitly rejects this standard practice. As Peter Fenton states, this departure from industry norms is intentionally extreme: 

> "It's the craziest thing. It's the craziest thing."

He emphasizes the difficulty of this principle, noting that common practice dictates otherwise: "Nobody can do that. And that that I think is the hard part, right?... no residual economics is the craziest thing." This policy means that a partner's economic rewards are entirely contemporaneous with their active work; once they leave, their financial claim on the firm ends. The extremity of the rule is its defining feature, serving as a clear, unambiguous test of the firm's values.

## Reinforcing a Collective Culture
The primary function of eliminating residual economics is to prevent the cultural decay that can occur when former partners retain a financial stake. Without ongoing claims, there is no basis for retired partners to attempt to influence future partnership decisions, investment choices, or cultural evolution. This ensures that the current, active partnership has full autonomy and responsibility for steering the firm. It transforms the partnership from a collection of individuals building personal equity into a true collective, where the focus is on stewarding the [[firm's brand value]] for the next generation. The policy forces a mindset where contribution is for the present institution, not for a future personal annuity.

## Legacy as the True Reward
Within this framework, the concept of [[legacy]] is elevated as the primary compensation for departing partners. Instead of a financial residual, a partner's reward is their lasting impact on the firm's reputation, values, and success. This includes the mentorship of younger partners, the quality of the investment portfolio they helped construct, and the reinforcement of a culture that can endure. By removing the monetary alternative, the firm posits that a genuine, proud legacy—knowing one contributed to an institution that thrives after one's departure—is a more meaningful and powerful form of value. This aligns the partner's incentives entirely with the firm's long-term health, making the [[collective good]] the undisputed priority.
