title: Gravity Pull of the Thing
---

The "Gravity Pull of the Thing" is a concept articulated by venture capitalist Peter Fenton to describe the instinctive, compelling attraction that a specific domain or idea exerts on a group or individual, directing their collective curiosity and energy. In Fenton's view, this gravitational pull often transcends deliberate strategy or analytical thesis, becoming an organic organizing principle for activity. He illustrated this with Benchmark Capital's focus on artificial intelligence (AI), which was less a calculated bet and more a natural convergence point drawn by an almost magnetic force.

## Defining "The Thing"
For Fenton, "the thing" denotes a field or innovation that commands intense, shared fascination and becomes the unambiguous center of attention. It is characterized not just by its market potential but by its ability to captivate a team's intuition and enthusiasm. The identification of "the thing" is often visceral, serving as a rallying point that feels inherently significant. Fenton's explanation underscores this:
> "AI was the thing. And even if it wasn't the thing, it didn't matter. That was like where we were drawn to. Like it was the thing that had this like gravity pull for us."
This statement highlights that the objective validity of "the thing" is secondary to its subjective pull; what matters is the cohesive direction it provides, functioning as a psychological and strategic lodestar.

## The Mechanism of Gravitational Pull
The "gravity pull" metaphor evokes a natural, persistent force that draws resources and focus without coercion. Much like celestial gravity, it aligns orbits of effort and discussion around a central point. In organizational settings, this pull manifests as a consistent tendency to explore opportunities, engage in conversations, and allocate energy toward that domain. For Benchmark, AI exerted this effect, meaning that their deal flow, research, and partnerships naturally coalesced around AI themes. This pull fosters a unified direction and reduces scattered initiatives, creating momentum that can be more sustainable than mandated priorities. It reflects a form of [[Collective Intuition]] where a team's shared instincts guide action.

## Implications for Decision-Making
Fenton's concept suggests that strategic focus can emerge from attraction rather than solely from analysis. By recognizing and embracing the "gravity pull of the thing," organizations can tap into authentic motivation and deep curiosity, which may lead to more committed and insightful engagement. In venture capital, this aligns with approaches like [[Thesis-Driven Investing]], but with an emphasis on organic draw over rigid frameworks. For Benchmark, trusting this pull toward AI allowed them to operate with a coherent, passionate focus, potentially uncovering opportunities that purely analytical methods might miss. It underscores the importance of cultivating environments where such gravitational centers can be identified and followed, leveraging natural enthusiasm for sustained exploration and execution.
