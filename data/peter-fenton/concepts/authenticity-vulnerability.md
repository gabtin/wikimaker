title: Authenticity & Vulnerability
---

**Authenticity & Vulnerability** is a principle articulated by venture capitalist Peter Fenton, describing the foundational interpersonal qualities he seeks in founders and values in professional relationships. It champions genuine self-presentation and the courage to admit uncertainty over curated expertise. Fenton posits that these traits are not soft skills but critical components for building the trust necessary for high-stakes partnerships, such as those between an investor and an entrepreneur. He directly contrasts this with inauthentic posturing, which he identifies as a major red flag.

## The Role in Building Real Relationships
For Fenton, the investment process is fundamentally about forming a deep, working relationship with a founder, which cannot be built on a facade. He argues that meetings should be spaces for open exploration, not performances. If a founder is guarded or attempts to project omniscience, it prevents the honest assessment and collaborative problem-solving essential for long-term success. Vulnerability, in this context, is the practical willingness to expose gaps in knowledge or challenges in the business. As Fenton states:

> "if someone's not willing to be vulnerable with us in the meeting and expose what they don't know and and be real, then how can we have a relationship?"

This openness allows both parties to engage with reality, setting the stage for authentic support and alignment. It transforms the dynamic from a transactional pitch to a mutual evaluation of fit and partnership potential.

## Rejecting "Fake It Till You Make It"
A core tenet of Fenton's view is the explicit rejection of the common adage "fake it till you make it," which he considers bad and dangerous advice. He believes that inauthenticity—manifested as posing, fakeness, or a relentless focus on perception—is highly detectable and destructive to trust. This is because stakeholders, from investors to potential employees, are constantly sensing for genuineness. When they detect a performance, it triggers doubt and disengagement.

Fenton observes that this trigger is universal in entrepreneurial ecosystems:

> "if there was one trigger for all of us in general, I think this is true in entrepreneurship, it's true for the employees you're recruiting, is that they think you're faking it."

The fear of being "found out" as less than perfect, therefore, is more damaging than simply acknowledging one's current limitations. A founder's authentic confidence stems from a clear-eyed view of their vision and current reality, not from a pretense of having all the answers. This builds a more sustainable and attractive foundation for a company's culture and [[Founder-Investor Fit]].
