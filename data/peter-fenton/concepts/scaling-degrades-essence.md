title: Scaling Degrades Essence
---

"Scaling Degrades Essence" is a concept articulated by venture capitalist Peter Fenton to describe the paradoxical effect where scaling a venture firm—through increasing capital under management, adding more partners, or executing more deals—actively undermines the very qualities that made it successful. At its core, the concept argues that the 'essence' of venture capital is the deep, partnership-based relationship with entrepreneurs. Fenton contends that pursuing growth for its own sake introduces activities and dynamics that erode this foundational element, leading to poorer outcomes for both founders and investors. The principle challenges the assumption that expansion naturally leads to greater success, positing instead that it can corrode the firm's fundamental value proposition.

## The Degradation of Founder Relationships
Fenton identifies the quality of the relationship with entrepreneurs as the primary casualty of scaling. In a scaled firm, partners are compelled to manage more capital and a larger portfolio, which dilutes their attention and availability. The intimate, trust-based collaboration that characterizes early-stage investing—where partners act as true extensions of the founding team—becomes unsustainable under the pressures of growth. As Fenton states:

> "the quality of the relationship with the entrepreneur is degraded by scaling"

This degradation occurs because scaling necessitates a shift from hands-on, intensive partnership to a more transactional, managerial approach. The firm's increased size and scope reduce the time and emotional bandwidth partners can dedicate to each founder, undermining the [[Founder-VC Fit]] that is crucial for navigating startup challenges. The essence of being a "partner" in the venture sense is lost when interactions become periodic check-ins rather than deep, embedded support.

## The Erosion of Partner Joy and Financial Returns
Beyond founder relationships, scaling also negatively impacts the venture partners themselves and the firm's financial performance. Fenton links the joy derived from the work—the intellectual engagement and personal satisfaction of building companies—directly to the essence of the practice. Scaling introduces administrative burdens, committee-based decision-making, and a focus on fund management over creative investing, which diminishes partner joy. Importantly, Fenton argues this isn't just a cultural cost but a financial one. He explains:

> "scaling just asking the question of like more capital equals a whole bunch of activities that I think degrade. Interestingly enough, they they they they eat at the essence of why we practice the business."

The activities required to manage scaled capital—such as pursuing later-stage deals, maintaining larger portfolios, and managing internal consensus—distract from the core competency of identifying and nurturing breakthrough ideas. This often leads to diluted returns, as the firm moves away from the high-conviction, high-touch model that generates outlier performance. The pursuit of [[Quantity Over Quality]] in deals can thus directly contradict the focus needed for superior returns.

## The Incompatibility of Scaling with Essence
The concept culminates in the assertion that the essence of venture capital—deep partnership—is fundamentally at odds with indiscriminate growth. Fenton's view challenges the conventional wisdom that bigger is always better in finance. For him, the venture business is a "practice" built on curated relationships and focused capital, not an asset management factory. Scaling transforms the firm's orientation from quality to quantity, from partnership to procession. This tension suggests that firms must consciously guard against scaling impulses that compromise their [[Authentic Engagement]] with startups. Preserving the essence requires discipline, often meaning staying small, focused, and turning away capital that cannot be deployed without degrading the core model. The concept serves as a reminder that in venture capital, the most valuable inputs—trust, attention, and shared mission—are inherently scarce and difficult to scale without loss.
