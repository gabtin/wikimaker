title: Degradation to Winning
---

**Degradation to Winning** is a concept articulated by venture capitalist Peter Fenton to describe a fundamental and negative shift in the venture capital industry. It refers to the industry's evolving focus from a long-term, service-oriented partnership with entrepreneurs to a short-term goal of "winning" deals in a hyper-competitive market flooded with capital. This shift, which Fenton explicitly calls a "degradation," programs entrepreneurs to optimize for factors that serve investors' immediate capital deployment needs rather than fostering the high-quality, enduring relationships necessary for building transformative companies.

## The Shift from Service to "Winning"
Historically, Fenton implies, the venture industry was oriented around serving entrepreneurs and acting as a long-term partner in company building. The degradation occurs when the primary objective changes. The system now incentivizes firms to prioritize securing an allocation in a hot deal—often referred to as "winning" the deal—above all else. This is driven by an environment of abundant capital where competition among investors is fierce. Fenton summarizes this shift starkly:

> "the degradation of our industry, and it really has been a degradation, is I think it's shifted, the the the system has shifted to winning. Our goal is to win."

In this framework, the act of deploying capital becomes a target in itself, potentially overshadowing the more nuanced work of [[Due Diligence]] and selective, conviction-based partnering.

## Misaligned Incentives and Entrepreneurial Programming
A central consequence of "degradation to winning" is the creation of misaligned incentives between investors and founders. When VCs are optimized for winning deals, they unconsciously (or consciously) signal to entrepreneurs what traits and metrics will make them a "winning" investment. Entrepreneurs, in turn, begin to shape their pitches, narratives, and even early company development to match these signals to secure funding.

Fenton argues that this dynamic programs entrepreneurs for selection criteria that are off-target for a genuine partnership:
> "So what's happening is the industry is programming entrepreneurs in a way to select for things that I think are offtarget and they're aligned with the target of the firms and the capital bases they're deploying but they're offt target relative to the quality of the relationship the entrepreneur seeks."

The selection begins to favor superficial markers of velocity or hype that align with a fund's deployment tempo, rather than deeper indicators of mission, values, and long-term [[Founder-Investor Fit]]. This can compromise the foundational trust required for navigating the inevitable challenges of building a company.

## Long-Term Consequences for the Ecosystem
The pervasive focus on winning deals undermines the very essence of the venture model, which is predicated on high-conviction, high-support partnerships over a decade or more. When the relationship begins as a transaction aimed at securing an allocation, it sets a foundation for a partnership that may lack the resilience and depth needed for true company building. This degradation can lead to a crowded market of well-funded but poorly matched companies and investors, increasing the likelihood of friction during difficult periods and potentially reducing the overall rate of authentic innovation. The concept serves as a critique of a market condition where the mechanics of capital distribution begin to corrupt the quality of the [[Venture Capital Partnership]] itself.
