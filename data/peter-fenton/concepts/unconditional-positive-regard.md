title: Unconditional Positive Regard
---

Unconditional Positive Regard, as discussed by venture capitalist Peter Fenton, is a concept adapted from humanistic psychology, specifically from the work of Carl Rogers. In the context of venture capital and founder support, it refers to a non-judgmental, empathetic understanding and acceptance of a founder's vision and person. This approach creates a foundation of trust and faith that enables founders to flourish, often believing in them more than they believe in themselves. Fenton argues that this is the highest form of support for a founder, transcending conventional advice or criticism by providing a psychological safety net that fosters authenticity and innovation.

## The Rogerian Foundation

Fenton's framework is directly inspired by Carl Rogers' concept of unconditional positive regard, a core tenet of client-centered therapy. Rogers posited that for individuals to achieve personal growth, they must experience acceptance and support without conditions or judgment. Fenton applies this psychological insight to the investor-founder relationship, suggesting that a similar environment of empathetic understanding can unlock a founder's potential. By suspending evaluation and offering genuine empathy, investors create a space where founders feel secure to articulate their visions and vulnerabilities, which is essential for bold entrepreneurship and effective leadership.

## Application in Venture Capital

In the venture capital firm Benchmark, Fenton and his colleagues operationalize unconditional positive regard as a foundational practice. This involves deep, active listening and a commitment to seeing the world from the founder's perspective, without imposing external benchmarks or premature criticism. The objective is to ensure that founders feel comprehensively recognized—not just for their business plans, but for their intrinsic motivations and character. As Fenton notes:

> "if benchmark is doing its best work, an entrepreneur comes in here and says, they see me"

This quote encapsulates the essence of the practice: founders leave interactions feeling truly witnessed and valued. This method contrasts sharply with more transactional or directive forms of support, emphasizing a partnership built on [[Psychological Safety]] and mutual respect. It requires investors to consistently demonstrate faith in the founder's journey, even during periods of uncertainty.

## The Impact on Founders

The provision of unconditional positive regard has a transformative effect on founders' confidence and resilience. By receiving steadfast, non-judgmental support, founders are emboldened to take calculated risks and persist through challenges. Fenton emphasizes that this belief often exceeds the founder's own self-assurance:

> "we've delivered unconditional positive regard because we believe in founders often times more than they believe themselves."

This external vote of confidence can catalyze a founder's ability to overcome self-doubt and access untapped potential. The trust fostered through this approach establishes a collaborative dynamic where founders feel empowered to make decisive moves and learn from setbacks. Ultimately, this nurtures [[Founder Flourishing]], enabling both personal growth and the sustained pursuit of visionary goals.
