title: Hiding Failures
---

In robotics research and demonstrations, Chris Paxton highlights the strategic practice of "Hiding Failures." He argues that by only showing successful runs and never showing failures, researchers and developers conceal the true limits of their systems. This is because when failures are visible, observers can discern the boundaries of what the system can achieve. Conversely, showing failures is portrayed as an act of confidence, indicative of robust and strong results.

## Key Points and Analysis

> "Never show your failures. This one might seem obvious — why would I show failures? — but if people can see where your model fails, they can start to see the limits of what you can do."

> "Only strong robotics papers and results can show failures with confidence."

Paxton's concept assumes that failures inherently reveal system vulnerabilities, and thus hiding them is a tactical move to maintain an appearance of infallibility. This implies a field where perceived capability often outweighs honest assessment, and where transparency is seen as a liability unless one has exceptional results. The practice can lead to inflated expectations, reduced collaborative problem-solving, and a culture that discourages sharing negative data. Connecting to Paxton's broader thinking, this likely critiques a research environment that rewards spectacle over rigor, advocating for confidence built on demonstrated resilience rather than curated success.
