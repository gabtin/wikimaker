title: Breakthroughs in Real-World Robotic Manipulation and Foundation Models
---

## Overview
Recent research has demonstrated a critical breakthrough: achieving reliable, long-horizon robotic manipulation in unstructured real-world environments. This progress, as discussed by Chris Paxton, is not about singularly revolutionary tasks but about unprecedented system reliability. It is enabled by foundational artificial intelligence models for robotics—often termed Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models or Large Behavior Models—which provide a high-quality base for advanced learning techniques. Paxton draws a direct analogy to large language models (LLMs) in AI, arguing that "the quality of pretraining [is] making the reinforcement learning problems tractable," just as it was for models like DeepSeek R1.

## Key Points & Analysis
> "We’ve similarly seen work like pi-0.6* from Physical Intelligence, which showed robots performing tasks like building cardboard boxes and making espresso drinks, reliably, in a way that humans might."

This illustrates the core achievement: end-to-end systems executing diverse, multi-step chores with human-like consistency in messy settings.

> "The base models of robotics are usually called Vision-Language-Action models or sometimes Large Behavior Models... they’re accomplishing the same thing."

These foundation models integrate perception, language understanding, and motor control into a single, pre-trained model that can be adapted (e.g., via fine-tuning or reinforcement learning) for specific tasks.

**Underlying Assumptions & Implications:** Paxton’s argument assumes that progress in robotics mirrors the "pretrain then specialize" paradigm that revolutionized AI. The implication is that robustness in the real world is now a software and data problem solvable by scaling these models and their training. This connects to a broader vision where general-purpose robotic competence is built not on rigid, hand-coded programs but on adaptable, learned models that understand language and the physical world.
