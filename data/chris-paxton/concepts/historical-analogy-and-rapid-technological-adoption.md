- Where the Horses Went
title: Historical Analogy and Rapid Technological Adoption
---

## Overview
Chris Paxton frames the current moment in robotics and AI through a historical analogy: the rapid replacement of horses by automobiles in the early 20th century. He argues that when a foundational technology finally "clicks," it triggers a swift and transformative adoption, reshaping society faster than anticipated. Just as horses vanished from cities almost overnight once their economic utility ended, Paxton suggests we are approaching a similar tipping point with intelligent machines. This change, however, is accelerated by modern connectivity, propagating "with all the speed of the internet" and making its widespread impact seem inevitable.

## Key Points
- **Historical Precedent:** The automobile displaced the horse within "just a couple decades," illustrating how a superior technology can rapidly overtake an established standard.
- **The "Click" Moment:** > "When a technology finally clicks, the changes spread faster than anyone expects and have far more serious implications for society."
- **Sudden Displacement:** Economic utility is key. > "As soon as the economic utility of the animals vanished, they disappeared from public life and the city changed forever essentially overnight."
- **Accelerated Diffusion:** Current adoption outpaces historical examples. > "And these changes seem to be propagating far faster than the changes we saw with automobiles... having propagated through society with all the speed of the internet."
- **Inevitability:** The trajectory appears set. > "It seems inevitable."

## Analysis
**Assumptions:** Paxton's analogy assumes that the horse-to-car transition is a valid model for AI adoption, that economic utility is the primary adoption driver, and that internet-era diffusion mechanisms fundamentally accelerate change.
**Implications:** If correct, society faces abrupt disruptions in labor, infrastructure, and social norms, necessitating proactive adaptation and policy planning for a transformed future.
**Broader Connection:** This concept aligns with Paxton's view that technological tipping points are predictable through historical lenses and that understanding these patterns is crucial for building societal resilience against rapid, foundational change.
