title: Secrecy for Hiding Limitations
---

## Overview
"Secrecy for Hiding Limitations" is a strategic tactic, as discussed by Chris Paxton, where organizations intentionally restrict access to their AI models to prevent external parties from discovering and publicizing the models' true weaknesses and functional boundaries. This approach is framed as a deliberate choice to maintain a perception of greater capability and competitiveness. By controlling the narrative and the testing environment, a company can avoid the reputational damage that comes from public, comparative benchmarking which would otherwise expose shortcomings.

## Key Points and Analysis

> "Don’t let other people run comparisons. Remember what happened with Llama 4: if other people can try your model out, they’ll quickly uncover its limitations. If you can keep your model secret, that’s best."

Paxton's argument treats model secrecy as a defensive business strategy. The reference to a hypothetical "Llama 4" incident underscores the belief that open evaluation is a primary risk, turning the community's scrutiny into a threat. The core assumption is that a model’s market value is tied more to perceived performance than to transparent, validated capability.

> "Absolutely don’t do what Physical Intelligence or NVIDIA do and open source your model so anyone can benchmark it."

Here, open-sourcing is positioned as a strategic error, directly contrasting with common industry practices that prioritize collaboration and trust through transparency. This reveals an underlying worldview that the AI field is a zero-sum competition where obscurity provides an advantage. The implication is that progress is driven as much by marketing and controlled perception as by technical excellence. This connects to a broader, pragmatic—and arguably cynical—perspective on AI commercialization, where managing external perception is as critical as internal R&D.
