title: Reviewer Acceptance of Partial Failure
---

Chris Paxton introduces the concept of "Reviewer Acceptance of Partial Failure" in the context of academic peer review. He argues that for honest scientific reporting, reviewers must tolerate cases where a new method does not outperform existing ones on every benchmark. This acceptance is vital to discourage the selective presentation of only favorable results, thereby promoting a more accurate representation of a method's capabilities and limitations.

## Key Points
> "On the same note, I think paper reviewers must be accepting of some results which aren’t as good as other methods; it must be allowable to fail at some benchmarks, or people will cherry-pick."

Paxton frames this as a necessary guard against publication bias. If reviewers demand universal superiority, authors are pressured to hide negative outcomes, leading to cherry-picked benchmarks that misrepresent true performance. Accepting partial failure encourages comprehensive reporting, where papers can honestly discuss where a method succeeds and where it does not, supporting incremental progress.

## Analysis
**Assumptions:** This concept rests on the assumptions that scientific progress is often iterative, that methods have domain-specific strengths, and that reviewers can distinguish between meaningful innovation and mere benchmark optimization.

**Implications:** Widespread adoption could reduce dishonest reporting, normalize the discussion of limitations, and shift review focus towards novel insights rather than blanket superiority. It challenges the "state-of-the-art-or-bust" mentality, potentially fostering more reproducible and trustworthy research.

**Broader Connection:** This idea aligns with Paxton's emphasis on research integrity and ethical communication. It positions the review process as a catalyst for realistic evaluation, advocating for a culture that values truthful disclosure over superficially perfect results.
