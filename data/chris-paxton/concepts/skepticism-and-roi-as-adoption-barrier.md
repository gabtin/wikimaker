- Why Not Everything is Automated in Manufacturing (Yet)
title: Skepticism and ROI as Adoption Barrier
---

## Overview

Chris Paxton identifies a critical, non-technical barrier to the adoption of industrial automation, particularly among small and medium enterprises (SMEs). He frames this barrier as a blend of cultural skepticism and financial caution, rooted in direct experience. The core idea is that decision-makers in manufacturing often have prior exposure—either personally or through trusted networks—to automation projects that failed to live up to their economic promise. This creates a powerful hesitation, where the perceived risk of a poor return on investment (ROI) overrides the potential benefits of new robotic systems.

## Key Points & Analysis

**The Concept:** Paxton pinpoints that skepticism is not abstract but is often built on concrete, negative experiences. As he states:
> "Skepticism: the idea that many people know someone or have themselves tried to deploy a new industrial robot, and have not gotten a good return on their investment."
This past failure creates a powerful adoption barrier because it shifts the conversation from theoretical potential to proven (in this case, negative) outcomes. The "ROI" here is not just a spreadsheet calculation; it becomes a symbol of wasted capital, operational disruption, and unmet expectations.

**Underlying Assumptions:**
1.  **Experience Trumps Marketing:** Anecdotal evidence from peers or personal history holds more weight than vendor promises or industry studies.
2.  **ROI is the Primary Metric:** Success or failure of an automation project is judged almost exclusively through a narrow, financial lens in the short-to-medium term.
3.  **Failure is Memorable:** A single failed deployment can sour an entire organization or network on automation for years, creating a lasting cultural hurdle.

**Implications and Broader Connection:**
This concept implies that overcoming adoption barriers requires more than just better or cheaper technology. It demands:
*   **Proven, Reliable Solutions:** Technologies must be demonstrably robust and easier to deploy successfully.
*   **New Business Models:** Approaches like Robotics-as-a-Service (RaaS) can directly address ROI fears by lowering upfront costs and aligning vendor success with customer outcomes.
*   **Building Trust:** The industry must address its own history of overpromising.

For Paxton, this skepticism is a central challenge to overcome. His broader focus on making robotics more accessible and practical for SMEs directly confronts this barrier by aiming to create solutions that are not only capable but also demonstrably reliable and economically viable from the very first deployment.
