title: Advancement and Pervasive Impact of Large Language Models
---

## Overview
Chris Paxton observes a period of "dramatic progress" in large language models (LLMs), citing advanced models like OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek's R1 as evidence. This progress is not confined to research labs but is characterized by its rapid and "widespread adoption across professions such as coding, law, and medicine." Paxton's core argument is that this shift is immediate and profound: **"Large language models are already significantly changing the way people work and rewriting the economy, like it or not."** The transformation is presented not as a distant future possibility, but as an ongoing, pervasive economic and professional reality.

## Key Points & Analysis
*   **Immediate, Widespread Impact:** The advancement is notable for its speed of integration into high-skill knowledge work. LLMs are not niche tools but are becoming pervasive across diverse fields.
*   **Economic Rewriting:** Paxton frames this as an active, disruptive economic force. The LLM's role is to "rewrit[e] the economy," suggesting fundamental changes to value creation, productivity, and possibly employment structures.
*   **Inevitable Adoption:** The phrase "like it or not" underscores a key assumption: that this transition is unavoidable. Resistance is futile, and the focus is on adaptation to a new technological reality.

**Underlying Assumptions & Implications:** Paxton's view assumes technological diffusion is accelerating and that LLMs possess sufficient capability to disrupt core professional tasks. The implication is a urgent need for societal and individual adaptation. This connects to a broader perspective of AI not as a mere tool, but as an active, shaping force—an "operating system" for work—that demands a re-evaluation of skills, business models, and economic policy in the present tense, not the future.
