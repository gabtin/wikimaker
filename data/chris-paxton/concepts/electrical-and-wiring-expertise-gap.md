- Why Not Everything is Automated in Manufacturing (Yet)
title: Electrical and Wiring Expertise Gap
---

## Overview

The **Electrical and Wiring Expertise Gap** describes a common, critical bottleneck in industrial automation deployments. According to robotics expert Chris Paxton, while shops may consider the robot or software, a less obvious but fundamental requirement is the custom physical integration of all components. This process demands specialized electrical knowledge that typical manufacturing personnel do not possess, creating a gap between purchasing automation and successfully installing it.

## Key Points

*   **Custom Integration Requirement:** Automation systems are rarely plug-and-play. They involve a variety of sensors, controllers, and the robot itself, all of which must be physically connected and powered.
*   **Need for Custom Electrical Panels:** Due to the unique combination of parts in each deployment, shops cannot use off-the-shelf electrical cabinets. They require a custom-built panel to house and organize the electrical components safely.
*   **The Core Gap:** This technical work requires specific expertise. As Paxton states directly:
    > "because there are so many custom parts and sensors, a shop looking to automate will need a custom electrical panel. They’ll need someone with wiring experience that they almost certainly lack in-house."
*   **Added Burden:** This gap forces shops to seek (and pay for) external systems integrators or new hires, adding significant upfront cost, time, and project management complexity to the automation process.

## Analysis

*   **Underlying Assumptions:** Paxton's concept assumes that small-to-midsize manufacturing shops are primarily staffed for production, not for advanced mechatronics integration. It frames electrical expertise as a discrete, non-core skill set that is nevertheless essential for modernization.
*   **Implications:** The gap is a hidden cost and a common point of failure. It can turn an apparently straightforward automation project into a protracted, expensive integration challenge, potentially derailing return on investment.
*   **Broader Connection:** This idea fits within Paxton's wider perspective that the true barriers to automation adoption are often practical "last-mile" integration issues—electrical, mechanical, and programming—rather than the cost of the robot itself. The expertise gap highlights that successful automation requires a broader ecosystem of skills that many facilities have not yet developed internally.
