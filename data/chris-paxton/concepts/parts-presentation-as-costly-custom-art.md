title: Parts Presentation as Costly Custom Art
---

## Overview
In discussions on robotics and automation, **"Parts Presentation"** refers to the critical subsystem that ensures parts reliably arrive at a robot in the correct position and orientation. As articulated by Chris Paxton, this domain is often described as a **"Costly Custom Art,"** highlighting that while the robot itself is a standardized tool, the system feeding it is almost always a unique, expensive, and hand-engineered solution. This makes parts presentation a major bottleneck in terms of cost, complexity, and reliability in automation projects.

## Key Points

### The "Art" of Customization
> "Parts presentation: basically, the “art” of building a reliable input system for parts to arrive at the robot; almost every one of these has historically been custom-made and is therefore wildly expensive."

Paxton frames it as an "art" to emphasize the absence of standardized, off-the-shelf solutions. Each part (e.g., a specific gear, bracket, or electronic component) has unique physical properties, requiring a custom-designed system—involving bowls, tracks, vibratory feeders, or complex vision-guided staging—to present it correctly. This custom work is not mass-produced, relying heavily on expert intuition and trial-and-error.

### The Hidden Cost Center
Paxton’s analysis places parts presentation as the primary cost driver in many automation cells. The robot arm and controller are often a smaller portion of the total system cost and engineering effort compared to the presentation system. It is the **"plumbing"** that makes or breaks the application's reliability, yet its development is often underestimated.

### The 80/20 Problem of Automation
> "almost every one of these has historically been custom-made"

This historical norm underscores a core assumption in traditional robotics: the robot's flexibility ends at its end-effector. The broader system must be perfectly tailored to its one specific task. This implies that true automation flexibility is a myth if every new part requires a completely new and expensive presentation apparatus. It shifts the focus from the robot's capabilities to the peripheral engineering challenge.

## Implications & Analysis
The concept assumes that part variability is a problem solved by fixed mechanical hardware, not by the robot's intelligence. This makes automation economically viable only for high-volume, low-mix production. Paxton’s framing connects to his broader advocacy for robotics solutions that embrace flexibility and perception, suggesting that overcoming the "costly custom art" requires smarter, more adaptive robots capable of handling less-perfectly presented parts, thereby reducing the need for expensive custom feeder systems.
