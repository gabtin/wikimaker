title: Suppressive Fire vs. Lethality as Primary Goal
---

Chris Paxton challenges the conventional emphasis on lethality in combat, arguing that for infantry—and potentially for ground robots—the primary goal has historically been **suppressive fire**, not inflicting casualties. This concept reframes the purpose of putting fire downrange: it is about control and denial, using the threat of force to fix enemies in place or force retreat, thereby shaping the battlefield without necessarily killing.

## Key Concepts and Evidence
Paxton's analysis hinges on a distinction between two objectives:
- **Lethality as Primary Goal**: The direct aim to kill or wound enemies.
- **Suppressive Fire as Primary Goal**: The use of fire to "force soldiers into cover or retreat to avoid harm," thereby achieving tactical advantages like area denial or movement protection.

He grounds this in historical infantry roles, stating:
> "Inflicting casualties, largely, is not their job and has not been their job through much of history."
Instead, the psychological and physical effect of sustained fire is paramount. As he notes:
> "But the act of firing on a position — of putting vast amounts of lethal power downrange — forces soldiers into cover or retreat to avoid harm."

This makes suppressive fire a tool for dominance and risk imposition, where the *capability* to inflict casualties, rather than the act itself, achieves the goal.

## Analysis: Assumptions and Implications
**Assumptions:** Paxton assumes that battlefield control is often more valuable than enemy attrition, and that psychological effects (fear, paralysis) are primary combat drivers. He also implies that technology should align with historical tactical truths.

**Implications:** For robotics, this suggests designing platforms optimized for persistent, area-denial fire rather than precision killing. It connects to broader military thinking about force multiplication, casualty aversion, and the moral dimensions of automated warfare—where suppression might be seen as a more acceptable, less escalatory use of force.

**Connection to Broader Thinking:** This idea likely part of a larger framework where Paxton views autonomy in warfare through a lens of tactical support and enhancement of traditional infantry functions, rather than wholesale replacement with lethal autonomous systems.
