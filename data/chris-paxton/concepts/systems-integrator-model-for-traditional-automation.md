- Why Not Everything is Automated in Manufacturing (Yet)
title: Systems Integrator Model for Traditional Automation
---

The traditional model for deploying industrial robotics is not handled by the end-user manufacturer, but by specialized firms. As described by Chris Paxton, this is the work of **systems integrators**, companies that focus on building a particular class of robotics automation solutions. They take on the full complexity of creating a working production line, from initial design to final deployment. This involves a comprehensive, custom-built approach for each unique application.

## Key Characteristics of the Model
*   **End-to-End Responsibility:** The systems integrator handles the entire process. This includes designing the assembly line layout, planning robot placement and sequences, integrating sensors and vision systems, and writing all necessary custom code.
*   **Customization for a Specific Task:** Each solution is tailored. > "They will plan camera placements, write code, hook up sensors, design custom tools or parts — whatever is necessary to produce the perfect fully-autonomous production line."
*   **High Expertise and High Cost:** The model requires deep, multidisciplinary expertise in mechanical, electrical, and software engineering, resulting in significant time and financial investment per installation.

## Analysis: Underlying Assumptions & Implications
This model assumes automation tasks are **static, repeatable, and valuable enough** to justify a large upfront engineering effort. The implication is a high barrier to entry: automation becomes a major capital project, feasible only for large-scale, high-volume production where the workflow will not change for years. It connects to broader critiques of traditional robotics as **inflexible and uneconomical for small-batch or rapidly changing production**, a contrast to the more adaptive, software-driven approaches Paxton often discusses in the context of AI and machine learning in robotics.
