title: Economic Logic of Autonomous Defense
---

## Overview
The **Economic Logic of Autonomous Defense** is a core argument for the deployment of autonomous weapons systems, emphasizing cost efficiency and sustainability in modern attritional warfare. The concept, as articulated by Chris Paxton, critiques traditional defense methods where the cost of interception often exceeds the cost of the threat. Paxton argues that "more autonomous and scalable solutions exist, but often interceptor missiles end up being more expensive than the robots they are shooting down!" The solution is to deploy autonomous platforms that use vast quantities of relatively cheap munitions to defeat more expensive incoming systems, thereby winning the economic calculus of an engagement. This logic mirrors existing systems like the Phalanx Close-In Weapon System (CIWS), which Paxton cites: "Think, similarly, to the Phalanx CIWS on American carriers: these shoot a lot of bullets (relatively cheap) to take out the incoming drone while protecting humans on their team."

## Key Points & Analysis
*   **Core Principle:** The primary metric is cost-exchange ratio. An effective defense must negate a threat at a lower financial cost than the attacker incurs, creating an unsustainable economic burden for the adversary.
*   **Defining "Scalable":** Paxton's emphasis on **scalable** solutions refers to systems that can be produced and deployed in large numbers without prohibitive cost or complexity, aligning with the economic logic.
*   **Underlying Assumptions:**
    *   Warfare is increasingly a contest of industrial and economic attrition.
    *   The cost of guided missiles and human-operated platforms will remain high relative to mass-produced autonomous drones and smart munitions.
    *   Autonomous systems can achieve sufficiently high accuracy to make the "volume of cheap fire" approach viable.
*   **Implications:** This logic shifts procurement and strategy toward high-volume, lower-cost autonomous systems. It suggests that human-piloted platforms or exquisite missiles may be economically unsustainable for routine defense against swarms of cheaper drones.
*   **Broader Connection:** This concept is a pillar of Paxton's broader advocacy for autonomous systems, framing them not just as technological tools but as essential economic instruments that make defense financially tenable in an era of proliferating robotic threats.
