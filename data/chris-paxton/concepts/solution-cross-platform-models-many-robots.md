title: 'Solution: Cross-Platform Models & Many Robots'
---

## Overview
Chris Paxton argues that the persistent challenge of meaningful robotics benchmarking will be resolved not by more simulated contests or narrow competitions, but through a practical, infrastructure-focused approach. The core solution hinges on two interdependent pillars: the widespread deployment of **many physical robots** and the development of **cross-platform models** capable of running robustly across diverse hardware. This is enabled by open projects that prioritize real-world testing and direct comparison.

## Key Points of the Concept
*   **The Fundamental Problem:** Current benchmarking often fails to measure true generalizability and practicality in real-world robotics.
*   **The Proposed Solution:**
    1.  **Many Robots:** A future with "lots and lots of robots" in various real environments provides the ultimate test bed.
    2.  **Cross-Platform Models:** Success is defined by creating "models that actually work across most of them." Robustness across different embodiments is the key metric.
*   **The Enabling Method:** Open projects like **Lingbot-VLA, DreamZero, and pi-0.5** are cited as prototypes of this approach. Their value lies in being "models that people can actually try out on different robots, use, and openly compare."
    > "In the end, robotics benchmarking will be solved by having lots and lots of robots, and models that actually work across most of them. More projects like Lingbot-VLA, DreamZero, and pi-0.5 — models that people can actually try out on different robots, use, and openly compare."

## Analysis & Implications
**Underlying Assumptions:** Paxton's view assumes that true progress in robotics is measured by practical utility and generalization, not optimized performance on a single task or platform. It assumes that openness and direct comparability accelerate progress more than isolated, proprietary efforts.

**Implications:** This framework shifts the focus from "winning a competition" to "building deployable assets." It implies that research value is tied to real-world accessibility and that robustness is a more important research target than peak performance in a controlled setting. It advocates for a community-built infrastructure of hardware and software.

**Connection to Broader Thinking:** This concept aligns with a pragmatic, engineering-focused perspective on AI and robotics. Paxton emphasizes solving real problems with working systems, valuing the messy complexity of physical hardware as an essential teacher, and fostering open ecosystems over closed benchmarks.
